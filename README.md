## 👋 Hey! I'm [ShaneC](https://github.com/ShaneC)

- 🏢 I'm a Product Manager at [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) (who occasionally writes some code)
- 🐣 I started coding at 12 when I accidentally learned PASCAL while trying to write bots to cheat at RuneScape
- 🔨 I'll occasionally throw together some handy scripts and tools to make life easier
- 💻 My go-to languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP -- but I'll also tinker with Python, C++, React, and Swift
- 📫 You can reach me at hey at chism.io
- 🌎 Or you can check out my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/shanechism)
